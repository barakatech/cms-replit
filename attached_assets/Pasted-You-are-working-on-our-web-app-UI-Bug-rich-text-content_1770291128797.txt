You are working on our web app UI. Bug: rich-text content is being displayed as literal HTML tags (e.g., "<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>...") instead of rendered formatting. This is happening in the content cards like “What is Bitcoin?”, “How It Works”, and “Risk Factors” where paragraphs, bold text, and lists should render properly.

GOAL
Render HTML stored in our CMS/DB as formatted content (paragraphs, <strong>, <ul>/<li>) while keeping the app secure (no XSS).

WHERE TO FIX
1) Find the component(s) that render these cards/sections (likely a “ContentCard”, “ArticleSection”, “Learn/Asset details”, or “InfoPanel” component).
2) Find the field being printed (e.g., `description`, `body`, `content`, `riskDisclosureHtml`, etc.) that currently uses `{content}` or `textContent` rendering.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- If the content is trusted HTML from our CMS, render it as HTML (NOT plain text).
- Sanitize the HTML before rendering (required).
- Allow only a safe subset of tags/attributes needed for our content:
  - Tags: p, strong, em, br, ul, ol, li, a, h1-h4 (optional), blockquote (optional)
  - Attributes: a[href], a[target], a[rel]
- For links: force `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` (optional if we want).
- If content is empty/null, render nothing or a fallback.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH (React)
- Add DOMPurify and sanitize before rendering.
- Render with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` using sanitized HTML.
Example:

import DOMPurify from "dompurify";

const ALLOWED_TAGS = ["p","strong","em","br","ul","ol","li","a","h1","h2","h3","h4","blockquote"];
const ALLOWED_ATTR = ["href","target","rel"];

function RichText({ html }: { html?: string }) {
  if (!html) return null;

  const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(html, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS,
    ALLOWED_ATTR,
    USE_PROFILES: { html: true },
  });

  return <div className="prose max-w-none" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: clean }} />;
}

Then replace the current `{content}` rendering with:
<RichText html={content} />

STYLING
- Use existing typography styles or add a minimal “prose” style (Tailwind typography plugin if already installed, otherwise basic CSS for p/li spacing).
- Ensure lists look correct (bullets, spacing).

DATA CONTRACT CHECK
- Confirm whether the CMS field is actually HTML or sometimes plain text.
  - If sometimes plain text: keep as text (escape) OR wrap plain text in <p> before sanitizing.
  - Do NOT double-escape HTML.

TEST / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- On the Bitcoin screen, the HTML tags should no longer appear as text.
- Paragraphs render as paragraphs, “Bitcoin (BTC)” appears bold, and Risk Factors render as a bulleted list.
- No console warnings/errors.
- Add a quick unit test or simple render test (if we have a test setup) verifying that `<strong>` becomes a bold element and that `<ul><li>` renders list items.

DELIVERABLE
- Commit the fix across all locations where CMS HTML content is rendered as literal tags (search for strings like "<p>" in UI output or search code for components rendering these fields).
- Provide a short summary of files changed and why.
