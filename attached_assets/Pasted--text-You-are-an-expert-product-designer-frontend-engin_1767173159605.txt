You are an expert product designer + frontend engineer. Upgrade the **Preview UI** for our CMS-driven stock landing pages to feel as polished as top brokerage stock pages (Robinhood/eToro-style), while still using ONLY our CMS data (no live market data scraping).

GOAL
Create a premium “Stock Page Preview” experience for /stocks/[slug] that:
- Looks modern and trustworthy (finance-grade)
- Works in Preview Mode for editors (draft content)
- Supports EN/AR with RTL
- Supports light/dark themes
- Is SEO-friendly (SSR metadata + JSON-LD from CMS)
- Uses a clean layout inspired by:
  - Hero with ticker, company name, price area + daily change
  - Interactive timeframe chart section
  - Jump-to navigation (About, Key metrics, News, FAQ, Risks)
  - Key metrics grid/cards
  - News feed module
  - Analyst/consensus-style module (optional + clearly “informational”)
  - FAQ accordion
  - Prominent disclaimers

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT scrape or fetch from any brokerage site.
- Use our CMS fields + dummy sample values (editor-provided) for preview.
- Avoid investment advice language (no “buy now”, “will rise”, “guaranteed returns”).
- Any “analyst forecast” module must include “not investment advice / informational only”.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Stack: Next.js App Router + TS + Tailwind.
We already have StockPage blocks in CMS. Enhance the **public renderer** + create a dedicated **Preview Mode**.

A) PREVIEW MODE
- Route: /stocks/[slug]?preview=1&locale=en|ar
- Only accessible if logged in to CMS (session-based guard).
- Preview loads DRAFT content from DB.
- If preview=0 or absent, only published content.

B) PAGE LAYOUT (VISUAL SYSTEM)
1) Sticky Top Ticker Bar
- Left: CompanyName (ticker) + exchange pill
- Center (desktop): mini nav links (Overview, Metrics, News, FAQ, Risks)
- Right: “Trade” CTA (neutral label like “Trade TSLA” or “View in app”) + share icon
- On scroll: condense bar but keep price + % change visible

2) Hero + Price Panel
- H1: “Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA)” (localized)
- Subtext: “Delayed prices • in USD” (localized, informational)
- Price block:
  - Big price number + daily change (+/-) + (1D)
  - Show timestamp “Last updated: …” (from CMS or preview timestamp)
- Include a small disclaimer under price area: “For informational purposes only.”

3) Chart Module (CMS-Driven)
- Use a simple line chart (Recharts) powered by CMS-provided dummy series OR editor-entered “performance points”.
- Timeframe tabs: 1D, 1W, 1M, 6M, 1Y, MAX (tabs switch series).
- Add note: “Past performance is not indicative of future results.” (localized)

4) Key Modules Row (cards)
- Market Sentiment card (from MarketSentimentBlock):
  - Segmented meter (Bearish / Neutral / Bullish / Mixed)
  - Drivers list (3–5)
  - Disclaimer line always visible
- Analyst/Consensus-style card (OPTIONAL module)
  - If CMS has “consensusLabel / rating / priceTarget / #analysts”, show it.
  - Add microcopy: “Composite of public analyst commentary. Not investment advice.”
- Quick actions card (neutral):
  - “Add to watchlist” (preview-only UI toggle)
  - “Set price alert” (UI only, no backend required for now)

5) Jump-To Navigation + Content Sections (like long-form broker pages)
- Use an “On this page” anchor nav (desktop) and horizontal sticky tabs (mobile)
Sections:
- Overview (rich text from CMS)
- Key metrics (KeyStatsBlock) in a responsive grid (2 columns mobile, 4 columns desktop)
- News module (CMS-curated list OR dummy seeded news items for preview)
  - Each item: title, source, date/time
- About the company (CMS rich text)
- FAQ accordion (FAQBlock)
- Risks & Disclosures (RisksBlock) — visually distinct + mandatory
- Related content (if present): cards linking to blog posts (optional if blog exists later)

6) Banner Slots Integration
- Render BannerSlotBlock positions in:
  - hero_top (above hero)
  - inline_1 (between chart and metrics)
  - sidebar_1 (desktop right rail)
  - footer_strip (near bottom)
- In preview mode, show a subtle “Preview banner” badge

C) COMPONENTS TO BUILD/REFINE
- StockPageShell (layout, sticky header, theme, locale)
- StockHero
- StockChartPanel (timeframe tabs)
- MetricsGrid
- MarketSentimentCard (segmented meter UI)
- NewsList (CMS-fed)
- FAQAccordion
- RisksPanel (high emphasis)
- BannerSlotRenderer (slot → placement matching)
- Skeleton loaders for preview fetching

D) THEMING + TYPOGRAPHY
- Tailwind light/dark using CSS variables tokens:
  - bg, fg, card, border, muted, primary
- Arabic RTL support:
  - Flip spacing, alignments, and icon directions
- Visual style:
  - Large, clean typography
  - Cards with subtle borders
  - Plenty of whitespace
  - Mobile-first responsiveness

E) SEO (PREVIEW + PUBLISHED)
- SSR metadata:
  - metaTitle/metaDescription from CMS per locale
  - canonical + robots rules
  - OG/Twitter tags
- JSON-LD injection from CMS schemas array
- Ensure exactly one H1

F) DUMMY DATA FOR PREVIEW (IF CMS FIELD EMPTY)
When the editor hasn’t filled fields yet, show tasteful placeholders:
- Price: 452.12, change: -0.51% (1D)
- Chart: generated sample series
- News: 5 sample items
- Metrics: Market cap, P/E, 52W range, avg volume, revenue, dividend yield (strings)

DELIVERABLES
- Implement the upgraded /stocks/[slug] page UI (published + preview)
- Add preview guard + draft fetching
- Add responsive sticky nav and sections
- Ensure EN/AR + light/dark work perfectly
- Update seed content to showcase the new layout with at least TSLA + 2 other stocks

Build this end-to-end in the existing Replit CMS codebase.
