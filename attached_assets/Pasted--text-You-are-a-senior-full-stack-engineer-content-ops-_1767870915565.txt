You are a senior full-stack engineer + content ops specialist. In our existing Baraka CMS (Next.js + Prisma + Postgres + Tailwind, Baraka DS light/dark, EN/AR + RTL, Blog ↔ Spotlight ↔ Newsletter automations, Auto Image Generator), seed the CMS with 30 production-ready articles for a GCC-based wealth-tech (getbaraka.com) and prefill ALL CMS fields so the content immediately appears across:

- Blog (Learn)
- Spotlight Banners (auto-created on publish)
- Newsletters (auto-drafted on publish using default template)
- Discover “Learn” modules (if present)

IMPORTANT:
- Content must be original, compliance-friendly, and not investment advice.
- Use neutral wording (no FOMO, no guarantees).
- Include “Capital at risk. Not investment advice.” in the footer/disclaimer blocks.
- EN is mandatory for all 30. AR is optional for seed; if AR not provided, set locale=EN only. (If you prefer both locales, create EN+AR for top 10.)
- Use the Auto Image Generator (no external scraping). Provide hero image generation guidelines in metadata and store them in the generator prompt field.
- Ensure slug uniqueness, canonical_url, SEO fields, tags, and schedule/publish states are correctly set.

========================================================
A) SEED PACK: 30 ARTICLES (STRUCTURED DATA)
========================================================
Create a seed file (e.g., /seed/content/articles_seed.json) with 30 items.
Each item must include fields that map 1:1 to our BlogPost model:

For each article:
- title
- slug (kebab-case, unique)
- excerpt (max 160 chars)
- content_json (preferred) OR content_html
- cover_image_guidelines (string prompt for our Auto Image Generator)
- tags (array)
- locale ("EN")
- status:
  - Set 20 to PUBLISHED (so automations fire and we get spotlights/newsletters)
  - Set 10 to DRAFT (for editorial pipeline demo)
- published_at (for published ones; spread across last 60 days)
- scheduled_at (optional for drafts; spread across next 30 days)
- seo_title (<= 60 chars)
- seo_description (<= 160 chars)
- canonical_url = "{WEBSITE_BASE_URL}/blog/{slug}"

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS PER ARTICLE:
- Use a consistent template in content_json blocks:
  1) HeroTitle (title + short dek)
  2) KeyTakeaways (3 bullets)
  3) BodySections (3–5 sections with headings)
  4) “GCC Context” callout (localized relevance: UAE/KSA/Bahrain/Qatar/Kuwait/Oman)
  5) “How Baraka can help” (neutral, non-promissory)
  6) FAQ (3–5 Qs)
  7) Disclaimer block (mandatory): “Capital at risk. Not investment advice.”

CATEGORIES / TAG TAXONOMY (use these):
- Basics, Markets, ETFs, Stocks, Halal, Crypto, Risk, Portfolio, Personal Finance, Taxes, UAE, KSA, GCC, Beginner, Intermediate

========================================================
B) HERO IMAGE GENERATION GUIDELINES (PER ARTICLE)
========================================================
For each article, set cover_image_guidelines as a generator prompt:
- Style: modern Baraka DS, minimal, premium
- Background: dark mode friendly, subtle gradients, Baraka green accent glow
- Elements: abstract finance shapes (no logos), simple icons, 1 headline line, 1 subtitle line
- Locale: EN
- Size: 1600x900
- Must be readable, high contrast, no clipped text

Example prompt template (use per-article variables):
“Create a Baraka-style hero image for a GCC wealth-tech article.
Theme: {title}. Mood: calm, premium, modern.
Background: dark charcoal with subtle gradient + soft Baraka green glow accent.
Add minimal abstract finance shapes (lines, charts, dots) + small icon relevant to {tags}.
Overlay text (safe margins): Headline ‘{shortHeadline}’ and subline ‘Learn the basics—no hype.’.
No company logos. No faces. 1600x900.”

Store this in:
- Asset.generated_prompt (if generated)
- BlogPost.cover_image_guidelines (if you have a field) OR meta_json

========================================================
C) AUTOMATIONS MUST FIRE + LINKAGES MUST APPEAR
========================================================
After seeding:
- For the 20 PUBLISHED BlogPosts:
  - Run Blog → Spotlight auto-create (status DRAFT unless auto-activate is ON)
  - Run Blog → Newsletter auto-draft using default template per locale
- Ensure each Blog list row shows badges:
  - Spotlight: Draft/Active + link
  - Newsletter: Draft/Ready + link

For each created SpotlightBanner:
- title = BlogPost.title
- subtitle = excerpt truncated 90
- image_url = blog cover image (reuse same asset)
- cta_text EN = “Read more”
- cta_url = /blog/{slug}
- placements default = BLOG + HOME
- source_type = FROM_BLOG

For each Newsletter:
- subject = BlogPost.title
- preheader = excerpt truncated 120
- hero image = blog cover image
- blocks populated from template schema
- status DRAFT

========================================================
D) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
========================================================
1) Create a seeding script:
- /scripts/seed_articles.ts
- Run via `npm run seed:content`
- Must be idempotent:
  - Upsert by slug+locale for BlogPost
  - Do not duplicate spotlights/newsletters (use unique constraints)

2) Auto Image Generator integration:
- For each post missing a cover image:
  - queue generation job
  - wait for completion OR mark job queued and continue
  - link resulting Asset to BlogPost.cover_asset_id
  - reuse cover_asset_id for spotlight/newsletter hero

3) Default Author:
- Create an “Baraka Editorial” user (role EDITOR) if none exists.
- Assign as author_id for seeded posts.

========================================================
E) DELIVERABLES / ACCEPTANCE
========================================================
- 30 BlogPosts exist with all CMS fields prefilled (title, slug, excerpt, tags, SEO, content, canonical, status).
- At least 20 are PUBLISHED and appear publicly.
- Each published post has:
  - a linked SpotlightBanner (draft/active)
  - a linked Newsletter draft
- Every item has a real image generated via our Auto Image Generator (no empty states).
- Blog, Spotlights, and Newsletters lists show correct link badges and preview thumbnails.

Now implement the seed pack + scripts + image generation + automation linkage in our existing Baraka CMS.
