You are a senior frontend engineer and product designer.

Build a responsive web UI (no backend required) for a **Dynamic Stock Landing Page CMS** for a fintech app called **baraka**.

Tech stack:
- React (single-page app)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- No need for real APIs: mock data in code
- Focus on **clean design** and realistic layout, not business logic

The product context:
- The CMS manages **10,000+ stock landing pages**
- It is **multilingual**: English (EN) and Arabic (AR, RTL)
- Each stock page combines:
  - Real-time style widgets (mock data) for price, market cap, sentiment
  - Long-form content blocks (overview, thesis, risks, FAQs, highlights)
  - Internal linking to similar stocks (“Similar stocks”, “Users also traded”, “ETFs in this theme”)
- Roles exist (Admin, SEO Manager, Content Writer, Compliance, Viewer), but for now this UI can assume “Admin” view with full access

🎯 What to build: 3 main screens

1) **Login Screen (simple)**
   - Minimal login form: Email, password, “Login” button
   - Branding: show "baraka CMS" in the header
   - No real auth, just navigate to the main CMS after clicking Login

2) **CMS Dashboard / Stock List**
   - Layout:
     - Left sidebar with navigation:
       - Dashboard
       - Stock Pages
       - Assets
       - Settings
     - Top bar with:
       - “baraka CMS” logo/title
       - Language toggle: EN / AR (for the UI labels, not full translations)
       - User avatar dropdown (fake)
   - Main content:
     - Table of stock pages with columns:
       - Ticker
       - Company name
       - Language coverage (EN/AR icons)
       - Status (Draft / In Review / Published)
       - Last updated
       - “Edit” button
     - Simple search bar (by ticker or company name)
   - When clicking “Edit”, open the Stock Page Editor (screen 3).

3) **Stock Page Editor (core screen)**

   This is the key design; make it feel like a real professional CMS.

   Layout:
   - Left sidebar (narrow): 
     - Sections list:
       - Metadata
       - Content
       - Dynamic Data
       - Internal Linking
       - Preview
   - Main area split into two columns:
     - Left: form editor
     - Right: live preview of the public stock page

   Form editor details:

   A) Metadata section
      - Fields with EN/AR tabs:
        - Meta Title (EN / AR)
        - Meta Description (EN / AR)
      - Show character count under each field
      - Add a toggle “Index this page (yes/no)”
      - A small “Search Result Preview” card showing how the title + description would appear in Google (mock).

   B) Content section
      - Show two language tabs at the top: **EN** | **AR**
      - Inside each tab, rich-text-like textareas for:
        - Company Overview
        - Investment Thesis
        - Risks
        - FAQs (can be simplified as a list with “Question” / “Answer” inputs)
        - Highlights
      - For the AR tab, visually right-align and indicate RTL in styling.

   C) Dynamic Data section
      - Read-only fields showing mock market data:
        - Price
        - Market Cap
        - Volume
        - P/E, EPS, Dividend Yield
        - Sentiment: % Buy / % Sell / % Hold
      - Render this as a card grid with labels and values, plus a small simplified chart (static SVG or placeholder) for “Performance (1D / 1W / 1M / 1Y)” for visual effect.
      - Include an info note: “These values are powered by the Market Data Service (read-only here).”

   D) Internal Linking section
      - Two sub-blocks:
        1. Auto suggestions (read-only list of tickers with reason tags like “Same sector”, “Users also traded”)
        2. Manual override:
           - Input fields where the Admin can add or remove related tickers
           - Show tags/pills for selected related stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG)
      - For design, use tags/pills style, like a modern CMS.

   E) Actions
      - At the top or bottom, show buttons:
        - Save Draft
        - Submit for Compliance Review
        - Publish (disabled if status is not approved – just visually disabled, no real logic)
      - Show current status badge (Draft / In Review / Published).

   Live Preview Panel (right side):
   - Show what the **public stock page** would look like.
   - Design a simple public view with:
     - Hero: Stock name, ticker, price, % change, “Invest” button
     - Below: 
       - Stats row: Market cap, Volume, P/E, Dividend Yield
       - Sentiment widget: 3-bar segment for Buy / Hold / Sell
     - Content section: Overview, Thesis, Risks (from EN or AR depending on a toggle in the editor)
     - Internal linking block at the bottom:
       - “Similar stocks” with a list of ticker cards
   - Add a toggle in the preview to switch between EN and AR view:
     - EN: LTR layout
     - AR: Mirrored layout (RTL) with right-aligned text

4) **Asset Library Screen (optional but nice)**
   - Accessible from sidebar “Assets”
   - Grid of assets: thumbnails for images/videos, list entries for documents
   - Each asset tile shows:
     - Thumbnail or icon
     - File name
     - Type (image/video/document)
     - Public/Restricted badge
   - Simple “Upload Asset” button (no logic needed)
   - Show fields for alt-text EN and AR on a simple side panel when clicking an asset.

Style guidance:
- Clean, modern, Fintech SaaS look.
- Use Tailwind for spacing, typography, and layout.
- Use neutral colors, light theme.
- Make sure the AR (Arabic) views clearly show RTL alignment in both the editor fields and the preview.

Data:
- Use hardcoded mock JSON data for:
  - A few stocks (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
  - Their metadata, content, and dynamic data
  - Some related stocks
- No real networking required.

Goal:
- I should be able to run this React app in Replit, click Login, see the dashboard, open a stock’s editor, edit EN/AR content, and visually see the public page preview update on the right, including RTL behavior for AR.
