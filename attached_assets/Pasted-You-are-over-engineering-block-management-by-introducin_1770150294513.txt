You are over-engineering block management by introducing separate schema blocks / block editors / block libraries. Remove that approach.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE

All schema blocks must live under “Content Block Types” and must be editable ONLY inside the Newsletter Edit screen.
There must be no standalone Block Editor, Schema Editor, or Block Library UI anywhere in the app.

What to build
1) Content Block Types (source of truth)

Inside Newsletter Edit → Content Blocks:

The Add Block dropdown must list all schema blocks:

Hero

Introduction

Featured Content

Articles List

Stock Collection

Assets Under $500

What Users Picked

Asset Highlight

Term of the Day

In Other News

Call to Action

Footer

This list replaces all previous block libraries and schema editors.

2) Editing behavior (CRITICAL)

When I add a block from Content Block Types:

The block is added to the newsletter immediately

The block auto-expands

I can edit all its schema fields inline

This is the only place block fields can be edited

There must be:

No separate “Edit Block” screen

No block configuration anywhere else in the app

3) Schema-driven editing (inside newsletter only)

Each block type has its schema rendered directly inside the newsletter edit page.

Examples:

Articles List block

When added inside newsletter edit:

Source Type: Internal | External

Number of articles

If Internal:

Article selector dropdown (searchable)

Manual or Latest

If External:

Repeating rows: title + URL + source

Stock Collection block

Mode: Manual | Dynamic

Manual → stock picker dropdown + limit

Dynamic → collection type + limit

Hero block

Title

Content

Image URL

CTA text + URL

CTA block

Button text

Button URL

Same pattern applies to all blocks listed above.

4) Architecture (important for implementation)

Do NOT create a Block Editor

Do NOT create Schema Blocks pages

Do NOT create Block Library pages

Instead:

Store schema definitions in code (or DB) as Content Block Types

Store actual values as Newsletter Block Instances

Render schemas only inside Newsletter Edit

5) Data model (simplified and correct)
Newsletter

id

title

status

NewsletterBlock

id

newsletterId

blockType (string)

orderIndex

values (JSON)

Schema definitions:

Live alongside code or DB as CONTENT_BLOCK_TYPES

Used only to render forms inside newsletter edit

6) UX requirements

“Add Block” button at top of Content Blocks

Drag-and-drop reorder

Collapse / expand each block

Delete block

Autosave on change (or explicit Save)

7) Acceptance test (must pass)

I open Newsletter Edit

I click Add Block

I see all schema blocks

I add Articles List

It expands immediately

I can select internal articles OR add external links

I refresh the page — everything persists

There is no other place in the app where blocks are edited

Final instruction

If you build any standalone block editor, schema editor, or block library page, that is incorrect.
All block management must happen inside the Newsletter Edit screen only and within that also i do not want to edit my blocks via the block editor in the newsletter instead directly from the edit newsletter section itself.
