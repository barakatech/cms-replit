You are an expert product designer + full-stack engineer. Build a premium **/discover** page that mixes:
- Stocks discovery (themes + trending + featured lists)
- Learn/Blog discovery (featured article + categories)
- Banners/Offers (campaign placements)
- Stock price subscription (watchlist alerts / price alerts subscription UI)
- Newsletter signup

This should feel like a modern brokerage “Discover” hub, using our Baraka dark-first theme + orange accent. Implement inside our existing Next.js + Tailwind + Prisma CMS project on Replit.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT scrape any external sites.
- Real-time market data will come from a third-party API later, but for now use DummyMarketDataProvider with the same interface.
- Keep compliance-friendly language. No “buy/sell recommendations”.
- Full EN/AR + RTL support + Light/Dark mode.
- All discovery sections must be CMS-configurable (curated tickers, featured themes, featured posts, banners).

ROUTES TO BUILD
- /discover (new main hub page)
- /stocks (stocks home page — already planned)
- /blog (blog home)
Optional:
- /discover/offers (list all offers)
- /discover/learn (learn index)

DISCOVER PAGE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (MATCH “HUB” FEEL)
The /discover page must include these modules in this order (responsive):

1) HERO: “Discover” + Search (Unified)
- Title (localized): “Discover”
- Subtitle: “Stocks, themes, and learning — in one place.”
- Unified search bar with tabs:
  - “Stocks” (search ticker/company)
  - “Learn” (search blog posts)
- Quick chips row (CMS-curated):
  - “Trending”, “Halal”, “ETFs”, “Beginner guides”, “Offers”
- Banner slot: hero_top (campaign)

2) OFFERS & BANNERS STRIP (Campaign Rail)
A horizontal carousel of offers/banners:
- Each card: image, headline, subheadline, CTA
- Click tracking via existing BannerEvent system
- CMS controls: order, scheduling, locale targeting
- This section is explicitly for “Offers”, “Subscription promos”, “Referral offers”, etc.
Banner slot keys to support:
- discover_hero
- discover_offers_rail
- discover_inline_1
- discover_footer_strip

3) STOCK THEMES & TRACKERS (Like your reference)
A) Featured row:
- Left big card: “Newly Added Theme”
- Right big card: “Theme of the Month”
B) “Other Themes & Trackers” grid (6–12 cards)
- Each theme card opens /stocks/themes/[slug]
All configured from CMS via StockTheme + DiscoverSettings.

4) TRENDING STOCKS (Real-time later, dummy now)
- Title + subtitle (localized)
- Tabs: “Gainers” / “Losers” / “Most watched” (CMS-driven lists for now)
- List rows with:
  - logo, ticker, name
  - price + % change (MarketDataProvider)
- “View all stocks” CTA -> /stocks

5) FEATURED STOCKS (Curated)
- Grid of 8–12 stock cards
- Each card:
  - ticker, name
  - price + % change
  - small sparkline optional
- “Explore stocks” CTA -> /stocks

6) STOCK PRICE SUBSCRIPTION (Alerts / Watchlist Subscription)
This is NOT paid subscription necessarily—treat it as “subscribe to price updates” (email/push/WhatsApp later).
Build a clean module with:
- Title: “Get price updates”
- Description: “Subscribe to price alerts for stocks you follow.”
- UI:
  - Input to add tickers (autocomplete from StockInstrument list)
  - Frequency dropdown: Instant / Daily / Weekly (UI + DB)
  - Channel selection UI (for now):
    - Email (enabled)
    - Push (disabled placeholder)
    - WhatsApp (disabled placeholder)
  - CTA: “Subscribe”
- Store in DB table PriceAlertSubscription (even if not fully functional):
  - email, tickers[], frequency, locale, createdAt
- Confirmation state (success toast + summary)

7) LEARN SECTION (Blog/Insights discovery)
- Left: Featured article (big card)
- Right: 3 smaller article cards
- Below: “Browse by topic” category chips + “Latest” list (5)
- “Go to Learn” CTA -> /blog
All curated by CMS:
- featuredPostId
- featuredSecondaryPostIds[]
- featuredCategories[]
- optional “Beginner collection” posts

8) NEWSLETTER SIGNUP (General)
Separate from price alerts to avoid confusion:
- Title: “Weekly newsletter”
- Description: “Market explainers, product updates, and new themes.”
- Email input + subscribe
- Store in DB table NewsletterSignup:
  - email, locale, createdAt, source="discover"
- Include privacy microcopy (localized).

9) FOOTER DISCLOSURES + FINAL BANNER
- Render discover_footer_strip banner slot
- Disclosures panel:
  - “Capital at risk. Information may be delayed. Not investment advice.” localized

CMS CONFIGURATION (ADMIN)
Create /admin/discover to manage the page content:
A) DiscoverSettings (singleton)
- heroTitle_en/ar, heroSubtitle_en/ar
- heroChips (array of {label_en/ar, href})
- featuredThemeNewSlug
- featuredThemeMonthSlug
- otherThemeSlugs[] (or auto by order)
- trendingTabs:
  - gainersTickers[]
  - losersTickers[]
  - mostWatchedTickers[]
- featuredTickers[]
- learnFeaturedPostId
- learnSecondaryPostIds[]
- learnCategorySlugs[]
- sectionVisibility toggles (turn sections on/off)
- defaultLocale behavior

B) Offers management
Reuse existing Banners system:
- allow selecting banners for “Discover offers rail” via placements:
  - pageType=discover, positionKey=discover_offers_rail
- scheduling + targeting already supported

C) Blog home controls
If not already:
- /admin/blog/home to set featured posts

DATABASE ADDITIONS (PRISMA)
- DiscoverSettings (singleton)
- PriceAlertSubscription
- NewsletterSignup
(StockTheme, StocksHomeSettings, StockInstrument assumed from previous prompt)

DUMMY DATA (SEED)
Seed:
- DiscoverSettings configured with:
  - featured themes (ADRs, Halal Stocks)
  - trending lists (TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, META)
  - featured stocks list (12)
  - learn featured post + 3 secondary posts
  - learn categories
- 6–10 offer banners with placements in discover_offers_rail and discover_footer_strip
- Dummy market data for all featured/trending tickers so prices render nicely

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (LOOK & FEEL)
- Use Baraka theme tokens (dark background, orange primary)
- Clean modular sections with thin dividers and generous spacing
- Cards are consistent (rounded-xl, border, surface backgrounds)
- Responsive:
  - Desktop: 2–3 column grids + side-by-side featured areas
  - Mobile: stacked sections, carousels swipeable
- RTL: ensure chips, arrows, and alignment adapt for Arabic

DELIVERABLES
- /discover page implemented with all 9 sections above
- Admin screen /admin/discover to configure content
- DB models + migrations + seed data
- Reuse banner system for offers rails + tracking
- Implement price alert subscription + newsletter signup DB storage + simple success states
- README: “Discover Page Configuration” + “Subscriptions (Price alerts vs Newsletter)”

Now implement end-to-end in the existing Replit project using dummy market data today, with clear seams for plugging in real-time APIs later.
