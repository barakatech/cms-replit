You are an expert product designer + frontend engineer. Redesign our **Stocks Home / Discover page** to match the layout in the provided reference screenshot (themes grid + trending stocks strip + stock directory list). Implement it in our existing Next.js + Tailwind + Prisma CMS project on Replit, using CMS configuration + dummy market data provider (real-time API later).

GOAL
Make /stocks (the Stocks Home page) look and behave like the reference:
1) “Explore Our Themes & Trackers” section with:
   - “Newly Added Themes” (big feature card)
   - “Theme of the Month” (big feature card)
   - “Other Themes & Trackers” (grid of small theme cards)
2) “Trending Stocks” strip with list rows + a small filter UI + carousel arrows
3) “Stocks & ETFs” directory section:
   - Search bar
   - Sort dropdown (Alphabetical / Popular / etc.)
   - A–Z letter index navigation
   - Paginated list of stocks/ETFs with logo + name + price + % change

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT scrape external websites.
- Market numbers (price/change) come from MarketDataProvider abstraction:
  - Dummy now, real API later.
- Themes/trackers must come from CMS (editable).
- Support EN/AR + RTL + light/dark theme using our Baraka color tokens.
- Keep compliance-friendly language.

DATA MODELS (ADD TO PRISMA)
1) StockTheme (Themes & Trackers)
- id
- slug (unique)
- title_en, title_ar
- description_en, description_ar
- isNew (boolean)
- isThemeOfMonth (boolean)
- isFeaturedNewlyAdded (boolean)  // for the large “Newly Added Themes” slot
- iconType (enum or string) OR iconUrl
- heroImageUrl (optional)
- tags (string[])
- tickers (string[])  // symbols included in theme
- order (int)
- status: published|draft
- createdAt, updatedAt

2) StocksHomeSettings (singleton)
- id (single row)
- heroTitle_en/ar (“Explore Our Themes & Trackers”)
- heroSubtitle_en/ar
- newlyAddedThemeSlug (string)   // which theme is shown in big left card
- themeOfMonthSlug (string)      // which theme is shown in big right card
- otherThemesTitle_en/ar
- trendingTitle_en/ar
- trendingTickers (string[])     // 6–12 symbols
- directoryTitle_en/ar (“Stocks & ETFs”)
- directoryDefaultSort (enum: alphabetical|popular)
- directoryPageSize (int)
- showETF (boolean) // optional
- updatedAt

STOCK LIST SOURCE
We need a stock directory list for the “Stocks & ETFs” section.
Implement a simple StockInstrument table (or seed from JSON):
- symbol, name, type (stock|etf), logoUrl(optional), exchange(optional), status
This is NOT market data; it’s just metadata for listing and search.

MARKET DATA
Use MarketDataProvider.getMarketDataBatch(symbols[]) to render:
- price
- changePercent
For the list rows and trending strip.
If market data missing, show “—”.

PAGE LAYOUT (MATCH SCREENSHOT)
A) Section 1: Explore Our Themes & Trackers
- Centered title + short subtitle
- Two big cards row:
  Left big card: “Newly Added Themes”
  Right big card: “Theme of the Month”
Each big card:
- Title label (small)
- Theme name (large)
- Short description
- Subtle divider line near top
- Whole card clickable -> /stocks/themes/[slug]

Below: “Other Themes & Trackers”
- Grid of 6 cards (2 rows x 3 on desktop; responsive)
- Each card has:
  - theme name
  - 1-line description
  - right arrow icon (like screenshot)
  - clickable -> /stocks/themes/[slug]

B) Section 2: Trending Stocks Strip
- Title: “Trending Stocks”
- Subtitle: “Stocks with the most unusual price changes…” (CMS editable)
- A compact control on the right:
  - dropdown: “Gainers” / “Losers” (UI only for now or CMS-driven)
  - arrows (prev/next) to cycle through pages of trending rows
- Trending rows layout:
  - Two-column rows (like screenshot):
    Each row item shows:
      - small logo
      - company name
      - symbol
      - price on right
      - % change colored positive/negative
  - Implement as a simple paginated carousel (no heavy library needed)

C) Section 3: Stocks & ETFs Directory
- Title: “Stocks & ETFs”
- Search input (search by name or symbol)
- Sort dropdown (Alphabetical / Popular)
- A–Z letter index row:
  - Clicking a letter scrolls to that section in the list OR filters list by starting letter
- List layout:
  - Two-column table-like cards (as in screenshot) on desktop
  - Single column on mobile
  - Each row:
    - logo + name + symbol
    - price + % change
  - Pagination controls at bottom

ROUTES TO ADD
- /stocks (this new home page)
- /stocks/themes (optional index of all themes)
- /stocks/themes/[slug] (theme detail page)
Theme detail page requirements:
- theme title + description
- list of tickers in theme with price/% change
- CTA: “View [ticker]” -> /stocks/[tickerSlug] (map symbol->stock page slug)

CMS ADMIN SCREENS
- /admin/stocks/home
  - Edit titles/subtitles (EN/AR)
  - Select “Newly Added Theme” (dropdown of published themes)
  - Select “Theme of the Month”
  - Manage trendingTickers list (add/remove/reorder)
  - Directory defaults (sort/page size)
- /admin/stocks/themes
  - CRUD themes:
    - title/description EN/AR
    - flags: isNew, isThemeOfMonth
    - tickers multi-select (from StockInstrument list)
    - ordering

SEED DATA (MUST)
Seed at least these themes (matching screenshot style):
- ADRs (isNew=true)
- Halal Stocks (isThemeOfMonth=true)
- Penny Stocks
- 52WK L (52-week lows)
- 52WK H (52-week highs)
- Gold ETFs
- Bitcoin ETFs
- Titans
Each theme must have EN+AR title/description and 6–12 tickers.
Seed StockInstrument list with 50–200 items (mix stocks + ETFs) using safe dummy metadata.
Seed trendingTickers with 8–12 symbols.
Dummy MarketDataProvider must return price/% change for the tickers used.

DESIGN/THEME
- Use our Baraka tokens (primary orange, dark surfaces)
- Cards: rounded-xl, subtle borders, clean spacing
- Match screenshot hierarchy:
  - section headers
  - thin dividers
  - minimal iconography (arrow)
- Ensure light mode still works and looks premium.

DELIVERABLES
- Implement the /stocks page with the 3 sections above
- Implement theme pages + admin management
- Add Prisma models + migrations
- Seed data to showcase exactly this layout
- Ensure EN/AR + RTL + theme toggle work

Now implement this end-to-end in the existing Replit project.
```
