You are an expert product designer + full-stack engineer. Build a premium **Discover Home** experience for our site that feels like a modern brokerage “markets discovery” page (similar in layout style to eToro’s stocks discovery), but powered by our CMS + dummy market data provider (no scraping, no real API integration yet).

SCOPE
Create TWO discovery home pages:
1) Stocks Home: /stocks
2) Blog Home: /blog
Plus a combined top-level “Discover” page (optional but recommended):
3) /discover (links to Stocks + Blog sections)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT scrape any external websites.
- Do NOT integrate real third-party APIs yet.
- Use our CMS content + DummyMarketDataProvider data interfaces.
- Must support EN/AR + RTL + light/dark.
- Keep compliance-friendly language (no “buy now”, no advice).

DATA SOURCES (SEPARATE THEM)
A) CMS (editorial & layout)
- Featured collections, hero copy, banners, curated lists, blog content
B) Market Data (numbers only)
- Use MarketDataProvider abstraction (dummy for now) for prices/change for tickers displayed

STOCKS HOME PAGE: /stocks (DISCOVER)
LAYOUT SECTIONS (match brokerage discovery patterns)

1) Hero + Search
- Large heading: “Discover stocks” (localized)
- Subheading (localized): “Explore popular companies and market themes”
- Search bar:
  - search by ticker/company name
  - results show instant list with logo, ticker, name
  - click navigates to /stocks/[slug]
- Optional filters row (chips):
  - “Trending”, “Most viewed”, “Top gainers”, “Top losers”, “Newly added”
  (For now these are CMS-curated toggles, not calculated.)

2) “Trending Stocks” Horizontal Carousel
- Card layout like eToro discovery:
  - Logo, ticker, company name
  - Price and % change (from MarketDataProvider dummy)
  - Small sparkline (optional; from provider series)
- “View all” link → /stocks?section=trending

3) “Biggest Movers” (Top Gainers / Top Losers)
- Two side-by-side panels (stack on mobile)
- Each panel shows 5–10 stocks with:
  - ticker, name, price, % change
- For now:
  - Movers list is CMS-curated
  - Numbers come from MarketDataProvider dummy

4) “Explore by Theme” Collections (CMS-defined)
- A grid of theme cards (like “AI”, “EV”, “GCC”, “Dividend”, “Tech Giants”, “Halal”)
- Each theme card:
  - title + short description + 6 tickers preview
  - click opens /stocks/collection/[slug] (collection page) OR filters /stocks?theme=...
- Create CMS entity: StockCollection
  - slug, title, description, localeContent
  - tickers[] (e.g., ["TSLA","NVDA","AAPL"])
  - heroImage optional
  - order, status

5) “Featured Stock Pages” (CMS-curated)
- Grid of 6–12 stock cards
- Supports “pin to top” and “new” badges (CMS flags)
- Use market data for price/change

6) Banner Slots (like your banner system)
- Render Banner slots on /stocks:
  - hero_top (above hero)
  - inline_1 (after trending carousel)
  - footer_strip (near bottom)
- Track impressions/clicks with existing banner events

7) Footer “Disclosures” Strip
- “Capital at risk. Informational only.” localized
- Keep it subtle but present

BLOG HOME PAGE: /blog
LAYOUT SECTIONS (modern editorial home)

1) Blog Hero + Search
- Title: “Learn” / “Insights” (localized)
- Search blog posts
- Category chips row

2) Featured Story (1)
- Large featured card with image, title, excerpt, category, read time
- Controlled by CMS “Featured” flag or “FeaturedPostId”

3) Latest Posts (list)
- Left: list of latest posts (10)
- Right (desktop): sidebar widgets:
  - “Top categories”
  - “Most read” (CMS-curated for now)
  - Banner slot sidebar_1

4) Topic Collections (CMS)
- “Beginner Guides”, “ETFs”, “Risk & Disclosures”, “Trading Basics”
- Each collection shows 3–5 posts

5) Newsletter CTA (UI only for now)
- Email input + “Subscribe”
- Store submissions in DB table NewsletterSignup (optional) OR stub endpoint
- Must include privacy microcopy

COMBINED DISCOVER PAGE: /discover (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
- Top navigation tiles:
  - “Stocks” (with trending preview)
  - “Blog” (with featured post preview)
- This becomes the entry point for discovery

ADMIN CMS REQUIREMENTS (NEW)
Add CMS management screens:

A) /admin/stocks/discover
- Manage:
  - Stocks hero title/subtitle per locale
  - Curated lists:
    - Trending tickers[]
    - Gainers tickers[]
    - Losers tickers[]
    - Featured tickers[]
  - Toggle “Show sparkline”
  - Banner slot visibility toggles (optional)
Store in a DiscoverStocksSettings singleton table.

C) /admin/blog/home

DUMMY DATA (SEED)
- Seed DiscoverStocksSettings with:
  - Trending: TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL
  - Gainers/Losers: curated 5–8 each
  - Featured: 8–12 tickers

MARKET DATA INTEGRATION (DUMMY NOW, REAL LATER)
- For each ticker shown on /stocks, call MarketDataProvider.getMarketData(ticker)
- Batch-fetch optimization:
  - Implement getMarketDataBatch(tickers[]) in provider for performance
  - Dummy provider returns from a map

UX DETAILS (MATCH “DISCOVERY” FEEL)
- Sticky top search on scroll (optional)
- Clean cards with:
  - ticker bold
  - company name muted
  - price prominent
  - change colored by positive/negative (use Tailwind classes)
- Responsive:
  - Mobile: carousels become swipeable
  - Desktop: 2–3 column grids
- Light/Dark: both polished

SEO
- /stocks and /blog should be SSR with proper meta title/description
- Add structured data:
  - ItemList schema for collections (optional)
- Ensure canonical tags and hreflang for EN/AR if implemented

DELIVERABLES
- /stocks discovery page with sections above
- /blog home page with editorial sections above
- Optional /discover page
- Admin screens + DB tables for settings/collections
- Seed script populating everything
- README section: “Discovery pages configuration”

Now implement this end-to-end in our existing Replit project, using dummy market data via provider abstraction for now.
